[N FLIGHT Tricks and Treats of Outland]
[D Guide designed for efficient completion of the Tricks and Treats of Azeroth achievement for Alliance characters:  https://Fyre.is/]

Welcome to *GideonDelta's Guides to WOTLK:* FLIGHT Tricks and Treats of Outland (Alliance) This guide is *intended* to be used by characters at the level of the highest zone entered with the appropriate riding skill.

My guides focus on efficiency. Whenever possible, I will take you the most direct route with the least amount of time between objectives and the least amount of backtracking.

This specific guide relies on you having a *Hearthstone* ready to quickly get back to Shattrath. A hearthstone set to Dalaran will also work as it has a portal to Shattrath. Keep this in mind when using this guide.

Go to your preferred *capital city* \\ Use the portal to [G57.5,51,1000 Blasted Lands][C] Blasted Lands
-- TO-DO Drop OFF

Proceed through [G89.5,50,100 Hellfire Peninsula][C] The Dark Portal into *Hellfire Peninsula*

[A Mage] Mages skip the hearth, cast [SP35715]
Use your [H Shattrath] or [H Dalaran], the latter taking the portal to Shattrath city [C] \\ If your [H] is not ready, start flying back [C]
If for some reason your hearth is set in another capital city besides Dalaran or Shattrath, hearth to that capital city, use the portal to Blasted Lands, and proceed through the Dark Portal. It's still closer than Stormspire.[O][C]

If you're at least unfriendly with the Scryers, I defaulted to Scryer's Tier. If you're Friendly with the Aldor or Hostile with the Scryers you should go to Aldor Rise.[O][C]

Go to [G27.5,49,10 Shattrath City][A Aldor > 1500][C] Aldor Rise in *Shattrath City*
Go to [G56,81,10 Shattrath City][A Scryers > -3000][C]  Scryer's Tier in *Shattrath City*

Go to [G56.5,35.5,100 Nagrand] Telaar in *Nagrand* [C]
Complete [QA12357][UI37586-]

[A Mage] Mages, again save yourself some time, cast [SP35715]
-- Teleport: Shattrath

Go to [G37,58,100 Shadowmoon Valley] Wildhammer Stronghold, Shadowmoon Valley [C]
Complete [QA12360][UI37586-]

As with Shattrath, after Wildhammer Stronghold you only need either the Scryer's or the Aldor's bucket. The guide defaults to the Scryer's because it's closer. If you're friendly with the Aldor's (and would get murdered by the Scryers) it should automatically send you to the Altar of Sha'Tar.

[A Aldor > 1500] Go to [G61,28,100][O][C] Altar of Sha'Tar
[A Aldor > 1500] Complete [QA12409][UI37586-]
[A Scryers > -3000] Go to [G56,60,100] Sanctum of the Stars
[A Scryers > -3000] Complete [QA12409][UI37586-]
*Congratulations!* You have completed the Outland portion of the Tricks and Treats of Azeroth meta achievement.
