[N58-80 TAXI Tricks and Treats of Outland]
[D Guide designed for efficient completion of the Tricks and Treats of Azeroth achievement for Horde characters:  https://Fyre.is/]
Welcome to *GideonDelta's Guides to WOTLK:* TAXI Tricks and Treats of Outland (Alliance)
This version of the Tricks and Treats of Outland guide uses, almost exclusively, the in-game TAXI (or Flight Path) system. If you're looking for the flying mount variant, refer to *FLYING* Tricks and Treats of Outland.
This guide is *intended* to be used by characters at the level of the highest zone entered.
My guides focus on efficiency. Whenever possible, I will take you the most direct route with the least amount of time between objectives and the least amount of backtracking.
