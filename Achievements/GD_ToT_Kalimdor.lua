Go to [G47,60,100 Mulgore][C] Bloodhoof Village
Complete [QA12362][UI37586-]
[A Mage] Mages, *SKIP* traveling to Camp Taurajo again. Cast [SP3566] to quick travel back to *Thunder Bluff* instead.
Go to [G44,59,100 Barrens][C] Camp Taurajo [UI37586-] \\ While TB is technically closer, waiting for a lift, traveling up the lift, and traveling up to the FP make the nearly AFK-able autorun to Camp Taurajo the superior choice

Go to [G65,34.5,20 Barrens][UI37586-][C] \\ These starting towns are unavoidably hands-on. This route is 50 percent closer than going to Crossroads.

Follow on to continue to the starting point of the guide for Tricks and Treats of Eastern Kingdoms

[A Mage] I haven't had the opportunity to test this portion out - It may be faster to to Teleport to Thunder Bluff, or maybe just follow the land directions. Do what you feel is best, just end up in Ratchet when you're done [O][C]
[A Mage] Mages, cast [SP3567]
[A Mage] Fly to [F Ratchet] \\ The next couple of steps will auto-complete once you arrive in Ratchet

Go to [G50,68.4,10 Durotar][C] and enter Valley of Trials
Go to [G41.6,73.3][C] Hidden Path
Follow path up and to right [G40.7,73,5][C]. If you go straight and off into the water you risk landing on rocks!
Press into the crevice of the rockface and you can easily walk up without any much or any jumping to [G40.5,72.8][C].
Carefully make your way back down to the river and cross it to [G65,34.5,20 Barrens]
[A Mage] Arrive in Ratchet [G63.6,38.6,10][C]
Go to [G63.6,38.6,10][C] and take boat to *Booty Bay*
