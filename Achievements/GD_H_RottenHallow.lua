[A Mage] Mages can shave some time by casting [SP3563]
Go back into [G66,21,25 Undercity] Undercity [O][C]
Fly to [F Tarren Mill]


Carefully make your way down the river to the [G54,58,50] eastside of Southshore around \\ Be aware there are guard and NPC patrols which will attack and flag you for PVP [C]

While avoiding guards, throw three [UI20387] into Southshore to complete [QC1657]

Enter the Southshore Inn's entrance [G50.4,58.5 Hillsbrad Foothills] [UI20387]
At the stack of kegs turn in [QT8322][UI20387]
*DO NOT FORGET* Accept follow up (from kegs) [QA8409][UI20387]

[A Mage] Mages can shave some time by casting [SP3563]
